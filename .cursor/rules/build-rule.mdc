### âœ… Rule: Clean Build Before Verifying Feature

After adding a feature, always ensure you verify it with a **clean build** to avoid stale artifacts and reduce feedback loops.

Run the following commands to clean and rebuild the Xcode project:

```zsh
# Clean build folder (derived data and intermediate build files)
xcodebuild clean -project Overly.xcodeproj -scheme Overly -configuration Debug

# Optionally remove DerivedData to fully reset (uncomment if needed)
# rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData

# Rebuild the project
xcodebuild -project Overly.xcodeproj -scheme Overly -configuration Debug build
```

Note: Most of the time you can build it without cleaning, and know just because you clean it doesnt mean the code doesnt have syntax errors or is buggy. It may also be your fault for buggy code

This ensures that you're testing your new feature from a clean state, catching issues earlier and preventing build artifact bugs.


This rule helps break out of feedback loops by enforcing a clean build check before assuming any feature works.
